    <p>A young man-we sketch his portrait at a dash. imagine to  yourself a Don Quixote of eighteen; a Don Quixote without his corselet, without his coat of mail, without his cuisses;a Don Quixote clothed in a wooden doublet, the blue color of which had faded into a nameless shade between less of wine  and a heavenly azure; face long and brown; high cheek bones,a sign of sagacity;the maxilliary muscles enormously developed,an infalliable by which a Gascon may always be detected,even without his cap-and our young man wore a cap set off with a sort feaher; the eye open and intelligent;the nose hooked,but finely chiseled. Too big for a youth, too small for a grown man,an experienced eye might have taken him for a farmer's son upon a journey had it not been dor the long sword which, dangling from a leather baldric,hit against the calves of its owner as he walked,and against the rough side of his steed when he was on horseback.</p>
