    <p>I am a very old man;how old i do not know. Possibly i am hundred,possibly i an more;but i cannot tell because i have aged as other men,nor do i remember any childhood. So far as i can recollect i a have always been a man, a man of about thirty. I appear today as i did forty years and more ago,yet i feel that i cannot go on living forever;that some day i shall die the real death from which there is no resurrection. I do not know why i should fear death,i who have died twice and am still alive;but yet i have the same horror of it as you who never died and it's because of this terror of death,i believe,that i am so convinced of my mortality. And because of this conviction i have determined to write down the story of the interesting periods of my life and of his death. I cannot explain the phenomenon; i can only set down here ith words of an ordinary soldier of fortune a chronicle of the strange events that befell him during the ten years that his dead body lay undiscovered in an Arizonal cave.</p>
